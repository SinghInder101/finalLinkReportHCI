Based on the gist of HCI and the principles that we learnt in HCI, we aimed to redesign three games to enhance user satisfaction and increase playability of those games. Our games fall under the category of puzzles and memory games, which require users to utilize their cognitive abilities to play the game effectively, rather than relying on chance or random actions.</p><p>We took very basic, simple, and popular games that every individual on the face of the earth have either heard about or played a lot of time in their childhood, and some might even play at the latter stages of their life. The games we are talking about include the very famous “Sudoku”, “Simon”, and “Match the Pairs”.</p><p>When we were conducting our research to find something to work upon, we came across these three games and realized that they have become obsolete and stagnant since they exist way before any of us were born and even before the internet came into existence. Therefore, they had a very lackluster design style and little to nothing advancement in gameplay compared to the fresh games being developed at the moment. This gave us an opportunity to use the HCI principles we learned about in order to improve these games by giving them a fresh feel, bring them out of the history books, present them in front of the world, and pay homage to our childhood.</p><p>We carried out extensive research on these games and came up with things that can be changed, redesigned, or excluded so that the games provide us with a novel sensation yet the very core still remains the same. The following report consists of all the HCI principles we could detect and enhance, a navigational map guiding us through each and every segment of the game, a thorough evaluation based on the heuristic principles, and future contributions that can be made to advance them even more, for all the three aforementioned games.<h1>Project Repository Link</h1><div><a class="anc" href="https://github.com/uwohci23/group-29"><h3>Repository</h3></a></div></p><h1>Report Links</h1><p>Click any of the buttons below to get redirected to it’s HCI report<div><a class="anc" href="https://642f648a3d85aa37c0e2914d--precious-arithmetic-1706c6.netlify.app/"><h3>Simon Game Redesign</h3></a></div><div><a class="anc" href="https://642f6283c4c73b3341950d65--timely-caramel-b58d45.netlify.app/"><h3>Tile Game Redesign</h3></a></div><div><a class="anc" href="https://harmonious-brigadeiros-0d06af.netlify.app/"> <h3>Sudoku Game Redesign</h3></a></div></p><h1>Conslusion</h1><p>This project aimed to breathe new life into three classic games - Sudoku, Memory Tile Game, and Simon Memory Game- by incorporating modern design techniques and user experience principles to enhance their playability and appeal. The team carefully selected these games based on their enduring popularity, cognitive benefits, and potential for improvement.</p><p>Through extensive research and analysis, the team successfully updated the games while preserving their essential features and charm. The redesigned games were then evaluated using heuristic principles to ensure optimal user experience, and navigational maps were developed to guide users through the various components of each game.</p><p>The result is a fresh, engaging, and accessible experience that honors the classics while introducing modern elements that resonate with today’s audience. The games not only offer entertainment but also contribute to players’ cognitive development, making them appealing to a broad range of users.</p><p>This project demonstrates the importance of applying HCI principles in the development and enhancement of games to ensure their continued relevance and positive impact on users’ lives. It showcases the potential for continuous innovation in digital entertainment and the need to embrace technology and evolving user expectations to create captivating experiences.</p></div></div></div></div>
